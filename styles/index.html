        <p>I'm 18 and this is my second semester. I have 3 brothers
            and 3 doggies that I love very much. I play soccer and enjoy
            doing anything sports related.</p>
        <p> My favorite scripture is Alma 32:27,
             â€œBut behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, 
             even to an experiment upon my words, 
             and exercise a particle of faith, yea, 
             even if ye can no more than desire to believe, 
             let this desire work in you, 
             even until ye believe in a manner that 
             ye can give place for a portion of my words."
